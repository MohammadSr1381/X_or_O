its a basic hebb network to specify which pattern is an O or X 

it actually cant detect O we just detect X if its not we assume its O 

hebb is not a good algorithm for this kind of tasks but might be useful for assignments or as an introduction

its awfully bad when it comes to detecting  patterns with less than 5 segments

gui is actually to make dataset after u made it there is no need to use it
